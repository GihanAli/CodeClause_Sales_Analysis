# CodeClause_Sales_Analysis
The current project aims at analyzing Store Sales dataset. This data set contains information about more than 890 stores. The project included summary statistics as well as visuals describing the features. The features have similar mean and median indicating the absence of outliers. Histograms show that the majority of the features have normal distribution. The data information showed that features have no missing values. 

> The exploratory data analysis reveals the following:
1)  the store sales is not generally associated with the number of customers who visited to stores on an average over month.
2)  there is not a consistent pattern in the relation between average daily customer visits and the store area.
3)  there is a relatively positive association between Store sales and store area.

> Finally, the linear regression shows that the input features have weak explanatory power for the Store sales.
